# ImageClassifier-GUI

## Make your own custom image classifier using googles tensorflow library without knowing how to actually code the thing.
## This project provides a GUI for users who want to make a binary image classifier using googles tensorflow and for who wants to mess with parameters and improve performance your more than welcome to tinker with the code in cnn_trainer.py, I have added comments on it for easy readability and so you can adjust learning parameters with ease.


## Just Train your model by giving it a sample (training set and test set) and it will make two files (Mapping and Classifier)
## use these files to load the model and test out your image classifer.

## Requirements:
## Python 3.5+ -> tensorflow (gpu or cpu version) , keras , h5py , numpy.

## You can use pip to install the above requirements.
